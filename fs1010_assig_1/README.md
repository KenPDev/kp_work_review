Hi Dave,

Here is a link to a repo that I can put examples in. I want to start with the fs1010 first assignment. I will also dig out my code for fs1020 final project because I had an issue getting my errors to work for my Gets (they worked for my posts though) and I never figured out why.

For now, starting in the folder fs1010_assig_1, I had issues with placement/positioning. I always do. I try various display, position and padding options but it's really guess work.

My first attempt (assig_1.html) has all the photos positioned where I want them, but I could only get the image to fill with a gradient on hover. (No diagonal dropdown with text).

In the second version (assig_1_version_2.html) I tried using the grid system instead. But here again I had trouble with positioning and padding and getting the unevenly sized photos to line up vertically.

There I tried using the backgrond linear gradient that you showed us but I just don't get it. Originally I used code that looked like this (which someone suggested to me) 

  background: linear-gradient(to left top, rgba(255,255,255,0) 50%, rgba(255,255,255,0.75) 50%),
  url('./assets/rom.jpg');

but I wanted the colours to be grey and when I tried to change them the effect stopped working.

The other big problem I had with that was that I could only get the diagonal gradient dropdown placed behid the image.

Can you give me some suggestion?
